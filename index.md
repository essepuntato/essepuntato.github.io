S. (pronounced "essepuntato" in Italian), better known as Silvio Peroni, is an assistant professor in Computer Science at the [Department of Classical Philology and Italian Studies](http://www.ficlit.unibo.it/), [University of Bologna](http://www.unibo.it/en), and proud member of the [Digital Humanities Advanced Research Centre (./DH.arc)](https://dharc.unibo.it).

This page is a sort of bucket where he puts something concerns his works, publications, hobbies, and the like, but you may find some more information about teaching material and courses at his [institutional homepage](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/silvio.peroni/en) (maybe). So, if you were looking for something interesting, smart and curious, this is not the right place. Sincerely.

Just in case you are still there, reading words and words of non-sense grammatical constructions, it is your choice.
