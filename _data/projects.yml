  description: "OpenCitations is a scholarly infrastructure organization dedicated to open scholarship and the publication of open bibliographic and citation data by the use of Semantic Web (Linked Data) technologies, and engaged in advocacy for semantic publishing and open citations. It has developed the OpenCitations Corpus (OCC) of open downloadable bibliographic and citation data recorded in RDF, and a system and resolution service for Open Citation Identifiers (OCIs), and it is currently developing a number of Open Citation Indexes using the data openly available in third-party bibliographic databases."

- name: GRAPHIA
  url: "https://graphia-ssh.eu/"
  description: "Social sciences and humanities (SSH) are essential for informing cultural, economic and ethical decisions, but they are often disconnected and inaccessible, limiting their impact on research and society. The EU-funded GRAPHIA project aims to create a comprehensive SSH knowledge graph (KG) that consolidates fragmented data into a single access point, enhancing the visualisation and analysis of SSH data. The project will employ an innovative KG approach, using AI to enrich, access, and analyse SSH knowledge, including the development of LLM4SSH (a large language model for SSH). This initiative will help researchers uncover insights from unstructured data, providing clearer insights into social phenomena and cultural trends. GRAPHIA’s SSH Citation Index will simplify the extraction and enrichment of citation data across SSH disciplines."

- name: LUMEN
  url: "https://lumenproject.eu/"
  description: "Research platforms that provide access to tools, services, and data have become invaluable in encouraging, enabling, and enhancing scientific research in recent years. Digital technologies have improved access while reducing costs. The EU-funded LUMEN project will use the successful GoTriple discovery platform to build a white-label discovery solution that can be accessible for any discipline. Three other platforms will be developed in molecular dynamics, mathematics, and Earth systems. The four platforms will be interoperable to facilitate dialogue and collaboration between scientists and domains without reducing specificities and needs of each. Furthermore, by developing new interdisciplinary solutions, the project will equip researchers with faster and easier research processes, powerful tools, and access to innovative resources."
