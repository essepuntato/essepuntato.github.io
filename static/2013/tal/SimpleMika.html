<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_2">

			According to the most cited definition of the Semantic Web literature, an ontology is an explicit specification of the
			conceptualization of a domain <span id="bbib1"><a class="intra_ref" href="#bib1" id="e_a_6">[1]</a>
. Guarino
			clarifies Gruber&rsquo;s definition by adding that the AI usage of the term refers to &ldquo;an engineering artifact, constituted by a
			specific vocabulary used to describe a certain reality, plus a set of explicit assumptions regarding the intended meaning of
			the vocabulary words&rdquo; <span id="bbib2"><a class="intra_ref" href="#bib2" id="e_a_7">[2]</a>
. An ontology is thus
			engineered by &ndash; but often for &ndash; members of a domain by explicating a reality as a set of agreed upon terms and
			logically-founded constraints on their use.
		</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_3">
Conceiving ontologies as engineering artifacts allows us to objectify them, separate them
			from their original social context of creation and transfer them across the domain. Problems arise with this simplistic view,
			however, if we consider the temporal extent of knowledge. As the original community evolves through members leaving and
			entering or their commitments changing, a new consensus may shape up invalidating the knowledge codified in the ontology.</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_4">

			To address the problem of ontology drift, several authors have suggested <em>emergent semantics</em> as a solution <span id="bbib3"><a class="intra_ref" href="#bib3" id="e_a_8">[3]</a>
. The expectation is that the individual interactions
			of a large number of rational agents would lead to global effects that could be observed as semantics. Ontologies would thus
			become an emergent effect of the system as opposed to a fixed, limited contract of the majority. While the idea quickly caught
			on due to the promise of a more scalable and easily maintainable Semantic Web, the agreement so far only extends to the basic
			conditions under which emergence would take place. The vision is a community of self-organizing, autonomous, networked and
			localized agents co-operating in dynamic, open environments, each organizing knowledge (e.g. document instances) according to a
			self-established ontology, establishing connections and negotiating meaning only when it becomes necessary for co-operation.
			Beyond the reasonable belief that individual actions in such a semantic-social network would lead to ontology emergence, there
			is a lack of an abstract model of such a system that could also explain the process of emergence. Thus there appears to be a
			large conceptual gap in the literature between the vision and the details of implementations of various semantic architectures
			based on P2P, Grid, MAS and web technology.
		</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_5">

			In this paper, we take a step back and formulate a generic, abstract model of semantic-social networks (Section <span id="bsec2"><a class="intra_ref" href="#sec2" id="ancbsec2">2</a></span>), which we will call the Actor&ndash;Concept&ndash;Instance model
			of ontologies. This model is built on an implicit (albeit crucial) realization of emergent semantics, namely that meaning is
			necessarily dependent on a community of agents. Inspired by social tagging mechanisms, we represent semantic-social networks in
			the form of a tripartite graph of person, concept and instance associations, extending the traditional concept of ontologies
			(concepts and instances) with the social dimension. We will show how lightweight ontologies of concepts and social networks of
			persons emerge from this model through simple graph transformations. In Section <span id="bsec4"><a class="intra_ref" href="#sec4" id="ancbsec4">3</a></span>, we will demonstrate these effects based on two independent, large scale datasets. In
			Section <span id="bsec7"><a class="intra_ref" href="#sec7" id="ancbsec7">4</a></span>, we evaluate one of our emergent
			ontologies (the result of a social-network based ontology extraction process) against the results of the traditional method of
			ontology extraction based on co-occurrence. Lastly, we conclude with a discussion of future work in Section <span id="bsec9"><a class="intra_ref" href="#sec9" id="ancbsec9">6</a></span>.
		</p>
		
<h2 class="svArticle" id="sec2">2. A tripartite model of ontologies</h2>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_6">

			While expert systems designed for centralized, controlled environments benefit greatly from the increasing expressivity of
			ontology languages such as OWL, especially in domains that lend naturally to formalization such as engineering and medicine,
			lightweight ontologies expressed in RDF(S) have spread and caught on in the loosely controlled, distributed environment of the
			Web <span id="bbib4"><a class="intra_ref" href="#bib4" id="e_a_13">[4]</a>
.
		</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_7">
The tendency towards lightweight, easily accessible mechanism for ontology and metadata
			creation is best evidenced by the recent appearance of folksonomies. Folksonomy (from folk and taxonomy) is a neologism for a
			practice of collaborative categorization using freely chosen keywords. Folksonomies (also called social tagging mechanisms)
			have been implemented in a number of online knowledge sharing environments since the idea was first adopted by social
			bookmarking site del.icio.us in 2004.</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_8">

			The idea of a folksonomy is to allow the users to describe a set of shared objects with a set of keywords of their own choice.
			What the objects are depends on the goal of the site: while bookmarks are the object of classification in del.icio.us, photos
			are shared in Flickr, scientific publications are tagged in CiteULike, while 43Things allows users to share their goals and
			plans (e.g. to travel or loose weight) by annotating their descriptions with keywords and connecting users with similar
			pursuits.<span id="bfn1"><a class="intra_ref" href="#fn1" id="ancbfn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span>
		
</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_9">

			It is important to note that in terms of knowledge representation, the set of these keywords cannot even be considered as
			vocabularies, the simplest possible form of an ontology on the continuous scale of Smith and Welty <span id="bbib5"><a class="intra_ref" href="#bib5" id="e_a_15">[5]</a>
. First, the set of words is not fixed. In fact, the users form no
			explicit agreement at all about the use of words, not even in the form of incremental, need-based, local and temporary
			agreements suggested by the research on emergent semantics <span id="bbib3"><a class="intra_ref" href="#bib3" id="e_a_16">[3]</a>
. Yet, the basic conditions of emergent semantics are given and as we will show there is semantics
			emerging at the scale of these systems. Second, although we use the term concept in the following, it is clear that there is no
			one-to-one correspondence between concepts and keywords. It is not always possible for the users to express a complex concept
			with a single keyword and thus they may use more than one tag to express the concept association that the item brings up in
			them. Lastly, the instances of folksonomies are instances only in the sense of classification.
		</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_10">

			In order to model networks of folksonomies at an abstract level, we will represent such a system as a tripartite graph with
			hyperedges. The set of vertices is partitioned into the three (possibly empty) disjoint sets <span id="mmlsi1" title="Click to view the MathML source"><span class="formulatext" title="click to view the MathML source"><em>A</em>={<em>a</em><sub>1</sub>,&hellip;,<em>a</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>}</span></span>,
			<span id="mmlsi2" title="Click to view the MathML source"><span class="formulatext" title="click to view the MathML source"><em>C</em>={<em>c</em><sub>1</sub>,&hellip;,<em>c</em><sub><em>l</em></sub>}</span></span>, <span id="mmlsi3" title="Click to view the MathML source"><span class="formulatext" title="click to view the MathML source"><em>I</em>={<em>i</em><sub>1</sub>,&hellip;,<em>i</em><sub><em>m</em></sub>}</span></span>
			corresponding the set of actors (users), the set of concepts (tags, keywords) and the set of objects annotated (bookmarks,
			photos, etc.). In effect, we extend the traditional bipartite model of ontologies (concepts and instances) by incorporating
			actors in the model.
		</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_11">

			In a social tagging system, users tag objects with concepts, creating ternary associations between the user, the concept and
			the object. Thus the folksonomy is defined by a set of annotations <span id="mmlsi4" title="Click to view the MathML source"><span class="formulatext" title="click to view the MathML source"><em>T</em>&sube;<em>A</em>&times;<em>C</em>&times;<em>I</em></span></span>. Such a network
			is most naturally represented as hypergraph with ternary edges, where each edge represents the fact that a given actor
			associated a certain instance with a certain concept. In particular, we define the representing hypergraph of a folksonomy <em>T</em>
			as a (simple) tripartite hypergraph <span id="mmlsi5" title="Click to view the MathML source"><span class="formulatext" title="click to view the MathML source"><em>H</em>(<em>T</em>)=〈<em>V</em>,<em>E</em>〉</span></span> where <span id="mmlsi6" title="Click to view the MathML source"><span class="formulatext" title="click to view the MathML source"><em>V</em>=<em>A</em>&cup;<em>C</em>&cup;<em>I</em></span></span>,
			<span id="mmlsi7" title="Click to view the MathML source"><span class="formulatext" title="click to view the MathML source"><em>E</em>={{<em>a</em>,<em>c</em>,<em>i</em>}|(<em>a</em>,<em>c</em>,<em>i</em>)&isin;<em>T</em>}</span></span>.
		</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_12">

			Tripartite graphs and hyperedges are rather cumbersome to work with. However, we can reduce such a hypergraph into three
			bipartite graphs (also called two-mode graphs) with regular edges. These three graphs model the associations between actors and
			concepts (graph <em>AC</em>), concepts and instances (graph <em>CI</em>) and actors and instances (graph <em>AI</em>). For
			example, the <em>AC</em> valued bipartite graph is defined as follows:
		</p>
		
<div class="formula" id="e_div_5">
			
<div class="mathml" id="e_div_6">
				
<span id="mmlsi8" title="Click to view the MathML source"><img border="0" height="43" src="images/1-s2_003.gif" width="381"></span>
			
</div>
		
</div>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_13">

			In words, the bipartite graph <em>AC</em> links the persons to the concepts that they have used for tagging at least one
			object. Each link is weighted by the number of times the person has used that concept as a tag. This kind of graph is known in
			the social network analysis literature as an affiliation network <span id="bbib6"><a class="intra_ref" href="#bib6" id="e_a_17">[6]</a>
, linking people to affiliations with weights corresponding to the strength of the affiliation. An
			affiliation network can be used to generate two simple, weighted graphs (one-mode networks) showing the similarities between
			actors and events, respectively. (At this point it is recommended to dichotomize the graph by applying some threshold.)
		</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_14">

			The process of folding a bipartite graph (the extraction of a one-mode network) can be most easily understood by looking at the
			matrix form of the graph. Let&rsquo;s denote this matrix as <span id="mmlsi9" title="Click to view the MathML source"><img border="0" height="16" src="images/1-s2_010.gif" width="62"></span>. As discussed before,
			<span id="mmlsi10" title="Click to view the MathML source"><span class="formulatext" title="click to view the MathML source"><em>b</em><sub><em>i</em><em>j</em></sub>=1</span></span> if actor <span id="mmlsi11" title="Click to view the MathML source"><span class="formulatext" title="click to view the MathML source"><em>a</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span></span>
			is affiliated with concept <span id="mmlsi12" title="Click to view the MathML source"><span class="formulatext" title="click to view the MathML source"><em>c</em><sub><em>j</em></sub></span></span>. We define a new matrix <span id="mmlsi13" title="Click to view the MathML source"><img border="0" height="17" src="images/1-s2_015.gif" width="58"></span>, where <span id="mmlsi14" title="Click to view the MathML source"><img border="0" height="21" src="images/1-s2_005.gif" width="117"></span>. In matrix notation <span id="mmlsi15" title="Click to view the MathML source"><img border="0" height="13" src="images/1-s2_017.gif" width="57"></span>. This matrix, known as
			the co-affiliation matrix, defines a social network that connects people based on shared affiliations. In our case the links
			are between people who have used the same concepts with weights showing the number of concepts they have used in common. The
			dual matrix, <span id="mmlsi16" title="Click to view the MathML source"><img border="0" height="13" src="images/1-s2_007.gif" width="61"></span> is a similar graph
			showing the association of concepts, weighted by the number of people who have used both concepts as tags. Note that in both
			graphs the diagonal of the corresponding matrices contains the counts of how many concepts or persons a given person or concept
			was affiliated with in the bipartite graph. We can use these values to normalize the association weights (e.g. by calculating
			the Jaccard-coefficient) and then filtering again based on the relative weights. In case of the <span id="mmlsi17" title="Click to view the MathML source"><img border="0" height="12" src="images/1-s2_018.gif" width="10"></span> social network, for example, this means that we have taken into account the relative
			importance of the link between persons.
		</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_15">

			In summary, the <em>AC</em> graph, the affiliation network of people and concepts can be folded into two graphs: a social
			network of users based on overlapping sets of objects and a lightweight ontology of concepts based on overlapping sets of
			communities. Thus in this simple model, social networks and semantics are just flip-sides of the same coin: the original
			bipartite graph contains all the information to generate these networks, while it is not possible to re-generate the original
			graph from them.
		</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_16">

			The other two bipartite graphs that we derived from the original tripartite model can also be folded into one-mode networks in
			a similar fashion. In particular, the <em>CI</em> graph leads to another semantic network, where the links between terms are
			weighted by the number of instances that are tagged with both terms. This type of semantic network is a much more familiar
			kind: it mimics the basic method applied in text mining, where terms are commonly associated by their co-occurrence in
			documents. The <em>AI</em> graph results in another social network of persons, where the weight of a pair is given by the
			number of items they have both tagged. We also get a network of instances, with associations showing the number of people who
			have tagged a given pair of instances.
		</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_17">

			In the following we focus our attention on the two lightweight ontologies based on overlapping communities (<span id="mmlsi18" title="Click to view the MathML source"><span class="formulatext" title="click to view the MathML source"><em>O</em><sub><em>a</em><em>c</em></sub></span></span>)
			and overlapping sets of instances (<span id="mmlsi19" title="Click to view the MathML source"><span class="formulatext" title="click to view the MathML source"><em>O</em><sub><em>c</em><em>i</em></sub></span></span>).<span id="bfn2"><a class="intra_ref" href="#fn2" id="ancbfn2"><sup>2</sup></a></span> The analysis of the emergent social networks is outside the scope
			of the current paper.
		</p>
		
<h3 class="svArticle" id="sec3">2.1. Ontology enrichment</h3>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_18">

			The community-based lightweight ontology <span id="mmlsi30" title="Click to view the MathML source"><span class="formulatext" title="click to view the MathML source"><em>O</em><sub><em>a</em><em>c</em></sub></span></span> that we extract
			from the affiliation network is rather peculiar from a knowledge representation perspective. Unlike the manually constructed
			thesauri known in the Semantic Web literature (such as Wordnet <span id="bbib7"><a class="intra_ref" href="#bib7" id="e_a_19">[7]</a>
), it more closely resembles the association thesauri studied in linguistics. An example is the
			Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus (EAT),<span id="bfn3"><a class="intra_ref" href="#fn3" id="ancbfn3"><sup>3</sup></a></span>
			which was collected in 1973 via an experiment using a group of university students as subjects <span id="bbib8"><a class="intra_ref" href="#bib8" id="e_a_21">[8]</a>
. The experiment consisted of handing a list of words to students who were
			instructed to write down against each stimulus word the first word it made them think of, working as quickly as possible. The
			obtained words were used in a next round of the experiment. (The cycle was repeated three times, by then the number of
			different responses was so large that they could not all be re-used as stimuli.)
		</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_19">

			Our associative ontology is similar to the EAT in that the weights of the links between terms are expressed as the number of
			people who make that association. The difference is that in the EAT collection, people are prompted explicitly to create links
			between concepts, while we deduce such links by observing tagging behavior. More importantly, however, both methods have the
			crucial property that the result clearly depends on the community of people who take part in experiment. The method of ontology
			engineering is particularly revealing, because once the initial set of words is selected there is only one parameter to the
			process: the population chosen. (In particular, the knowledge engineer has no other role than handing out questionnaires and
			collecting the responses.) Some of the results are likely to hold for other communities (like the overwhelming reaction of
			saying <em>Noah</em> when hearing the word <em>ark</em>), but many of the aggregated associations are driven by the collective
			mind set of the subjects of the experiment. A collective mindset that is likely shaped by the well-known law of community
			formation: interaction creates similarity, while similarity creates interaction.
		</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_20">

			We cannot only repeat the experiments with different communities, but given some information about the social structure of the
			community, we could also extract local ontologies by limiting our tripartite ontology to the associations of a certain
			sub-community of actors. Note that this is the principle of locality in action, one of the expected hallmarks of emergent
			semantics <span id="bbib3"><a class="intra_ref" href="#bib3" id="e_a_22">[3]</a>
. We will demonstrate this effect in
			Section <span id="bsec6"><a class="intra_ref" href="#sec6" id="ancbsec6">3.2</a></span> where we extract an ontology of
			research topics in the Semantic Web domain.
		</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_21">
In modern terms, the EAT is an emergent ontology based on empirical data. Unlike
			ontologies that are meant to codify fixed agreements, all graphs that we derive are also emergent in the sense of evolving
			dynamically with the Actor&ndash;Concept&ndash;Instance network. Changes in the original network can occur in a number of ways. Users may
			join or leave the community, changing the set of actors. The focus of the community may shift, affecting the set of items
			tagged and the concepts used. Last, the understanding and use of terms may change, reflecting in the set of associations
			between concepts and instances created by the users.</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_22">

			Although our association networks are very simple ontological structures, there are several opportunities of enriching them
			with additional semantics. We start by observing that a significant drawback of the EAT is the heterogeneity of terms. Our
			emergent ontologies will also likely to contain a diverse mixture of specific and generic terms, i.e. terms that we can
			unambiguously place in a clearly defined context (e.g. instances such as <em>Peter</em>) and terms that can occur in multiple
			contexts of use (e.g. <em>war</em>). From a network view, general words are therefore more likely to bridge different clusters
			of words, while specific terms are expected to exhibit a dense clustering in their neighborhood. This suggest an opportunity to
			distinguish between these two categories by computing the <em>clustering coefficient</em>, the <em>(local) betweenness
				centrality</em> or the <em>network constraint</em> on our terms <span id="bbib6-2"><a class="intra_ref" href="#bib6" id="e_a_24">[6]</a>
 and <span id="bbib9-2"><a class="intra_ref" href="#bib9" id="e_a_25">[9]</a>
. These well-known ego-network measures of Social Network Analysis are
			readily available in popular network analysis packages such as Pajek <span id="bbib10"><a class="intra_ref" href="#bib10" id="e_a_26">[10]</a>
 and UCINET <span id="bbib11"><a class="intra_ref" href="#bib11" id="e_a_27">[11]</a>
.
			Based on the same observation, we also expect that clustering algorithms can help us in finding synonym sets of the more
			specific terms. There is a wide range of clustering algorithms available in the above mentioned network analysis packages,
			based on different definitions of cohesiveness.
		</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_23">

			We may also extract broader/narrower term relations typical of thesauri using set theory. In an ideal situation, we would say
			that Concept <em>A</em> is a super-concept of Concept <em>B</em> if the set of entities (persons or items) classified under <em>B</em>
			is a subset of the entities under <span id="mmlsi31" title="Click to view the MathML source"><span class="formulatext" title="click to view the MathML source"><em>A</em>(<em>B</em>&sube;<em>A</em>⇋<em>A</em>&cap;<em>B</em>=<em>B</em>)</span></span>. We might
			also add the criterium that the set of <em>A</em> should be significantly larger then the set of <em>B</em>, i.e. <span id="mmlsi32" title="Click to view the MathML source"><span class="formulatext" title="click to view the MathML source">|<em>B</em>|/|<em>A</em>|&lt;<em>k</em></span></span>
			for some value of <em>k</em>. In principle, such an ordering allows us to define a Galois lattice using the subset relation. In
			practice, such a lattice would be very sparse (considering the number of entities and the number of possible subsets over
			them), so we will approximate this method by looking for near-perfect overlaps, i.e. <span id="mmlsi33" title="Click to view the MathML source"><span class="formulatext" title="click to view the MathML source">|<em>A</em>&cap;<em>B</em>|/|<em>B</em>|&lt;<em>n</em></span></span>
			for some value of <em>n</em>. Finding appropriate values for the <em>k</em>, <em>n</em> parameters of the model is the task of
			the researcher.
		</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_24">

			The reader should note that the meaning of these broader/narrower relations are very different, depending on whether we analyze
			the <span id="mmlsi34" title="Click to view the MathML source"><span class="formulatext" title="click to view the MathML source"><em>O</em><sub><em>c</em><em>i</em></sub></span></span> or the <span id="mmlsi35" title="Click to view the MathML source"><span class="formulatext" title="click to view the MathML source"><em>O</em><sub><em>a</em><em>c</em></sub></span></span>
			ontology. In the first case, the interpretation is that all (or most) of the items classified under the narrower term also
			appear under the broader term. In other words, what we extract is a classification hierarchy. In the second case, the meaning
			is that all the persons associated with the narrower term are also associated with the broader term. In other words, we extract
			a hierarchy based on sub-community relationships.

<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_25">

			In the following, we demonstrate the broad applicability of the Actor&ndash;Concept&ndash;Instance model of ontologies by looking at two
			different semantic social networks. Our first data set comes from an existing web-based social bookmarking tool called
			del.icio.us (Section <span id="bsec5"><a class="intra_ref" href="#sec5" id="ancbsec5">3.1</a></span>), while the second case is
			built on synthetic data obtained by using web mining techniques (Section <span id="bsec6"><a class="intra_ref" href="#sec6" id="ancbsec6">3.2</a></span>). We will show how the abstract model applies to the particular cases and demonstrate our method of
			ontology emergence based on the graph transformation described above.
		</p>
		
<h3 class="svArticle" id="sec5">3.1. Ontology emergence in del.icio.us</h3>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_26">
According to the definition of author Joshua Schachter, del.icio.us is a social
			bookmarking tool. Much like the similar functions of browsers, del.icio.us allows users to manage a personal collection of
			links to web sites and describe those links with one or more keywords. Unlike stand-alone tools, del.icio.us is a web-based
			system that allows users to share bookmarks with each other. Bookmarks can be browsed by user, by keywords (tags) or by a
			combination of both criteria. Further, the user interface encourages exchange by showing how bookmarks are linked together via
			users and tags. In terms of the Actor&ndash;Concept&ndash;Instance model, registered users of del.icio.us are the actors who create or
			remove associations between terms and webpages (instances) by adding or deleting bookmarks.</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_27">
From the perspective of studying emergence, del.icio.us is remarkable for the dynamics of
			its user base. The young, technologically aware community gathering around the site closely follows the latest news and trends
			in web technology as well as the evolving vocabulary of the field. Beyond technology, del.icio.us users also post-bookmarks
			related to current topics in politics, media, business and entertainment. The emphasis on timeliness is reinforced by listing
			bookmarks in a backward-chronological order as it is typical for blogs.</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_28">
The process of annotation is made as easy as possible. A single textbox allows users to
			enter a set of words without any recommendations made by the system. On the downside, this means that synonyms are common in
			the folksonomy, e.g. &ldquo;semanticweb&rdquo;, &ldquo;semweb&rdquo; are different keywords. Ambiguity is also present, since users often pick overly
			general terms to describe items (such as &ldquo;web&rdquo;, &ldquo;tool&rdquo; and other popular terms). Further, users often make the mistake to enter
			key phrases instead of keywords (e.g. &ldquo;Bill Clinton&rdquo;), where the words are subsequently parsed as separate tags (&ldquo;Bill&rdquo; and
			&ldquo;Clinton&rdquo;); or they escape the one-word-only limitation by concatenating words. Case sensitivity and the use of punctuation
			marks further pollute the del.icio.us namespace. However, at the scale of system (over 30 thousand registered users in December
			2004) the imperfections of tagging are reduced to an acceptable level. On the plus side, users benefit from instant
			gratification in the form of linkage to other relevant, timely, socially-ranked posts.</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_29">

			del.icio.us exposes tagging data in the form of RSS feeds, which we have collected using a focused RDF crawler. The crawler was
			initialized with the single most popular tag (&ldquo;web&rdquo;) and have traversed the RSS network in a breadth-first-search manner,
			following links to tags mentioned in the descriptions of items. The sample data that we collected &ndash; over a million triples of
			RDF &ndash; was stored using the Sesame storage and query facility <span id="bbib12"><a class="intra_ref" href="#bib12" id="e_a_30">[12]</a>
. The sample represents 51,852 unique annotations of 30,790 URLs, by 10,198 persons using 29,476
			unique tags.<span id="bfn4"><a class="intra_ref" href="#fn4" id="ancbfn4"><sup>4</sup></a></span>
		
</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_30">
Next, we have generated both the Actor&ndash;Concept and Concept&ndash;Instance graphs. In order to
			scale down the dataset (without loosing much information) and to avoid strong associations with a low support we have filtered
			out those entities that had only a minimal number of connections, i.e. those tags that had less than ten items classified under
			them and those persons who have used less than five concepts.</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_31">

			Subsequently, we have extracted the above mentioned two kinds of ontologies by folding these graphs using the network analysis
			package Pajek. As a reminder, the first ontology (<span id="mmlsi36" title="Click to view the MathML source"><span class="formulatext" title="click to view the MathML source"><em>O</em><sub><em>a</em><em>c</em></sub></span></span>) is based on
			actors sharing concepts as interests, i.e. the associations reflect overlapping communities of interests, while the second
			network (<span id="mmlsi37" title="Click to view the MathML source"><span class="formulatext" title="click to view the MathML source"><em>O</em><sub><em>c</em><em>i</em></sub></span></span>) reflects the co-occurrence of tags
			on items. We have filtered the networks based on the absolute strength of associations. Next, we applied geometric
			normalization to the resulting graphs and filtered edges again based on the relative strength of the associations. We have
			chosen the thresholds in such a way to obtain networks of equal size (438 concepts). <span id="bfig1"><a class="intra_ref" href="#fig1" id="ancbfig1">Fig. 1</a></span> shows a high level view of the <span id="mmlsi38" title="Click to view the MathML source"><span class="formulatext" title="click to view the MathML source"><em>O</em><sub><em>c</em><em>i</em></sub></span></span>

			The results show clear evidence of emerging semantics in both cases, but the networks we obtain still show very different
			pictures. With an equal number of vertices, the densities of the two networks are quite different (0.01 for the <span id="mmlsi40" title="Click to view the MathML source"><span class="formulatext" title="click to view the MathML source"><em>O</em><sub><em>c</em><em>i</em></sub></span></span>
			network, 0.006 for the <span id="mmlsi41" title="Click to view the MathML source"><span class="formulatext" title="click to view the MathML source"><em>O</em><sub><em>a</em><em>c</em></sub></span></span> network), and so is the amount of
			clustering present (the average clustering coefficients are 0.2 and 0.03, respectively).
		</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_35">

			The selection of concepts in the two networks is also very different: only 64 concepts are present in both networks of the
			total of 438 nodes in each graph. (A sample is included in <span id="btbl1"><a class="intra_ref" href="#tbl1" id="ancbtbl1">Table 1</a></span>.) A closer look reveals that the concepts within the clusters of the first network are often
			very specialized terms, while those in between the clusters are overly general terms. A look at the terms with the lowest
			clustering and highest betweenness centrality confirms this hypothesis. The top five terms with highest betweenness are <em>up</em>,
			<em>cool</em>, <em>hot</em>, <em>in</em>, <em>to</em>. Noticeable also is that the terms with the highest clustering and lowest
			network constraint are those related to sex. As mentioned before, the second network shows much less clustering: overly general
			and overly specific terms are both missing.

			The clue to the different qualities of these networks lies in the difference in the way associations are created between the
			concepts. In the first case, there exist a strong association between concepts if they share a large percentage of items, <em>independent
				of the number of users interested in them and regardless if these associations were added by the same users or not</em>. The
			resulting distribution of association weights shows a very slow decline, the average weight is fairly high. In the second case,

			However, the <span id="mmlsi47" title="Click to view the MathML source"><span class="formulatext" title="click to view the MathML source"><em>O</em><sub><em>c</em><em>i</em></sub></span></span> semantic network ignores the
			relevance of the individual concepts from the user perspective and as such it gives an inaccurate picture of the community.
			Concepts related to sex, for example, get a misleadingly high centrality in the network due to the specificity and extent of
			the vocabulary used to describe sex-related sites. On the other hand, the more evenly distributed community-based network (<span id="mmlsi48" title="Click to view the MathML source"><span class="formulatext" title="click to view the MathML source"><em>O</em><sub><em>a</em><em>c</em></sub></span></span>)
			contains concepts that are actually important to del.icio.us users. These concepts almost all come from the computer domain,

			reality as they are not biased by the actual number of items that have been tagged with them.
		</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_41">

			The ignorance of the item-based extraction method towards the number of users also makes it problematic to extract taxonomic
			relations. Namely, many of the relations we extracted are based on the word usage of a small number of users, and in the worst
			case a single user. The Concept&ndash;Actor ontology yields much more easily interpretable results, shown in <span id="btbl3"><a class="intra_ref" href="#tbl3" id="ancbtbl3">Table 3</a></span>. As discussed before, these are sub-community relations: the
			community associated with a narrower term is a sub-community of the community associated with the broader term. Nevertheless,
			even here we find an association created by a single story marked by a large number of users. This suggests an improvement to
			our original method, namely filtering out concepts that have only a limited number of items or persons associated to them. We
			take this into account as we move on to generalize our method to community-based ontology extraction from Web pages.

			We conclude by noting the potential application of the results to improving del.icio.us itself, e.g. by offering search and
			navigation based on broader/narrower terms. Considering the dynamics of the community and the extent of neologism, the
			ontologies emerging from folksonomies such as del.icio.us also have a large potential for enriching established, but slowly
			evolving linguistic ontologies such as Wordnet (<span id="btbl3"><a class="intra_ref" href="#tbl3" id="ancbtbl3">Table
					3</a></span>).
		</p>
		
<h3 class="svArticle" id="sec6">3.2. Community-based ontology extraction from Web pages</h3>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_44">
Folksonomies such as del.icio.us are effective, because they attract sizeable
			sub-communities of users pursuing similar interests. Nevertheless, the community of del.icio.us is still a niche compared to
			the general web population, just as the number of web sites tagged is only a fraction of the number of pages on the Web.</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_45">
We would like to show in the following that even without explicitly assigned tags, it is
			possible to extend the idea of community-based ontology extraction to the Web. Let&rsquo;s suppose that we have a selected a
			community, whose members will play the role of Actors in our model, and we have prepared a list of terms whose associations we
			are interested in. The instances of our model are the pages of the Web. Further, we assume that a web page is tagged by a
			concept if the concept occurs on the page.</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_46">
Based on these assumptions, the Concept&ndash;Instance ontology is straightforward to create:
			we can use a search engine to obtain page counts for all pairs of concepts and then normalize by their separate page counts.
			This is the basic co-occurrence analysis method of text mining.</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_47">

			Generating the Actor&ndash;Concept ontology requires another broad assumption. We will say that there is an association between a
			concept, a person and a web page if the name of the person and the label of the concept co-occur on the page. This association
			represents a weaker commitment than in the case of folksonomies, because it is not guaranteed that the association is made <em>by</em>
			the person. Nonetheless, we can now generate the bipartite graph of persons and concepts by measuring the association using
			page counts from the search engine.
		</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_48">

			First, we measure the association between a person (e.g. <em>&ldquo;Peter Mika&rdquo;</em>) and a concept (e.g. <em>&ldquo;Semantic Web&rdquo;</em>) by
			submitting a Boolean query combining the two terms (e.g. <em>&ldquo;Peter Mika&rdquo; AND &ldquo;Semantic Web&rdquo;</em>). We normalize the result
			with the number of pages where the concept occurs. We then repeat this with the same concept and the names of all other members
			of the target community. We calculate the mean strength of association with the concept of <em>&ldquo;Semantic Web&rdquo;</em>. Lastly, we
			associate those members of the community with this concept whose association strength is at least one standard deviation higher
			than the mean. (Note that this is a slightly more sophisticated method of filtering than a general threshold.) We can now fold

<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_49">

			Our method of community-based ontology extraction have been implemented as part of the Flink system. The system is a web-based
			presentation of the social networks and research interests of Semantic Web researchers.<span id="bfn5"><a class="intra_ref" href="#fn5" id="ancbfn5"><sup>5</sup></a></span> The community of researchers represented in Flink includes all authors,
			program committee members and organizers of all past international Semantic Web events from 2001, altogether 607 persons. The
			system extracts the social network of researchers as described in <span id="bbib13"><a class="intra_ref" href="#bib13" id="e_a_47">[13]</a>
 and associates them with research topics using the search engine Google.
		</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_50">

			Flink can also be used to perform co-occurrence analysis and generate the <span id="mmlsi50" title="Click to view the MathML source"><span class="formulatext" title="click to view the MathML source"><em>O</em><sub><em>c</em><em>i</em></sub></span></span>
			ontology. We improve the basic method by adding the disambiguation term <em>&ldquo;Semantic Web&rdquo; OR ontology</em> to the queries sent
			to the search engine, limiting the items returned to those relating to the Semantic Web.
		</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_51">

			The resulting ontological structures are not included here due to limitations of space, but we strongly encourage the reader to
			consult them online.<span id="bfn6"><a class="intra_ref" href="#fn6" id="ancbfn6"><sup>6</sup></a></span> To make the networks
			comparable, we have included only the 100 strongest associations in each network. Again, we see a significant difference in the
			set of concepts remaining in the networks. Namely, from the original 60 terms (selected manually from the proceedings of the
			ISWC events), the method of text mining found the strongest associations between more general terms. Specific concepts related
			to the Semantic Web seem to float to the periphery and are misplaced in general. For example, the term <em>FOAF</em> is related
			to <em>XML</em> and <em>OWL-S</em>, technologies not directly related to FOAF. <em>Annotation</em> is related to <em>alignment</em>
			and <em>databases</em>. The term <em>ontology</em> is associated, among others, with <em>HTML</em>, <em>XML</em> and <em>databases</em>,
			concepts not directly related to the understanding of ontologies in the Semantic Web community.
		</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_52">

			The <span id="mmlsi51" title="Click to view the MathML source"><span class="formulatext" title="click to view the MathML source"><em>O</em><sub><em>a</em><em>c</em></sub></span></span> association network represents a
			clear improvement in these respects. The method found correct associations between domain specific concepts. For example, the
			term <em>FOAF</em> is linked here to <em>Redland</em> and <em>Sesame</em>, the triple stores preferred by FOAF developers for
			their scalability. Terms related to ontology languages (<em>OWL</em>, <em>RDF</em>, <em>OIL</em>, <em>DAML+OIL</em>, <em>ontology
				languages</em>, etc.) are correctly clustered together, just as the technologies related to ontology storage (query languages,
			triple stores), with terms related to ontology development (<em>OilEd</em>, <em>OntoEdit</em>, <em>ontology development</em>)
			connecting the two clusters. More general technologies are also placed correctly in context, i.e. corresponding to the way they
			are used in the Semantic Web. For example, <em>NLP</em> is tied to the notions of <em>annotation</em> and <em>ontology
				learning</em>.
		</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_53">

			The difference in the node sets can be explained in a similar way as in the case of del.icio.us: the <span id="mmlsi52" title="Click to view the MathML source"><span class="formulatext" title="click to view the MathML source"><em>O</em><sub><em>c</em><em>i</em></sub></span></span>
			network ignores the overall relevance of these concepts to the Semantic Web community. Considering the associations, we believe
			that there is another effect in play. By querying the associations of persons first and then linking concepts through
			overlapping communities, we simulate the effect of first asking the members of the community to associate themselves with
			certain research interests and then relating these interests through overlapping communities. Overlapping communities turn out
			to be a stronger link than overlapping sets of web pages. A possible explanation is that even after including the
			disambiguating term in the query, the search engine still suffers from <em>knowing too much</em>, blurring away
			community-specific interpretations.
		</p>
		
<h2 class="svArticle" id="sec7">4. Evaluation</h2>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_54">

			In absence of a golden standard, evaluating the results of ontology learning or ontology mapping is a difficult task:
			inevitably, it requires consulting the community or communities whose conceptualizations are being learned or mapped. In order
			to evaluate our results, we have thus approached in email 61 researchers active in the Semantic Web domain, most of whom are
			members of the ISWC community and many of them are in the graph-theoretical core of the community.<span id="bfn7"><a class="intra_ref" href="#fn7" id="ancbfn7"><sup>7</sup></a></span> The single question we asked was <em>In terms of the
				associations between the concepts, which ontology of Semantic Web related concepts do you consider more accurate?</em> Lacking a
			yardstick, there is no principled correct answer to this question that we expected to receive. Instead, we were interested to
			find out if there is a majority opinion emerging as an answer and if yes, which of the two ontologies (produced by the two
			different methods) would that majority accept as more accurate.
		</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_55">
Many respondents expressed difficulty in answering the question due to the (intentional)
			lack of further explanations or instructions, e.g. what the associations mean, but also due to the very different node sets of
			the two semantic networks. Nonetheless, out of the 33 respondents only three persons were not willing to express any preference
			(even if a slight one) for one network or the other. Twenty-three respondents were members of the ISWC community and 15 of them
			belong to the core of the community.</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_56">

			The distribution of the answers for the various subgroups are summarized in <span id="btbl4"><a class="intra_ref" href="#tbl4" id="ancbtbl4">Table 4</a></span>. First, taking all responses into account, we can conclude that the participants
			consider the <span id="mmlsi54" title="Click to view the MathML source"><span class="formulatext" title="click to view the MathML source"><em>O</em><sub><em>a</em><em>c</em></sub></span></span> network as a more accurate
			representation of associations between the concepts than the <span id="mmlsi55" title="Click to view the MathML source"><span class="formulatext" title="click to view the MathML source"><em>O</em><sub><em>c</em><em>i</em></sub></span></span> network (the
			result is significant at a level of <span id="mmlsi56" title="Click to view the MathML source"><span class="formulatext" title="click to view the MathML source"><em>p</em>=0.01</span></span>). The majority vote becomes even stronger if we consider only
			the members of the ISWC community, i.e. the persons whose name has been used to extract the semantic network. Thus as a second
			finding we can also conclude that the <span id="mmlsi57" title="Click to view the MathML source"><span class="formulatext" title="click to view the MathML source"><em>O</em><sub><em>a</em><em>c</em></sub></span></span> network is
			considered more accurate particularly by those whose names were used in the extraction process. The results become even more
			conclusive if we only consider the votes from the core members of the community. Based on this finding and assuming a
			continuum, we can state that the <span id="mmlsi58" title="Click to view the MathML source"><span class="formulatext" title="click to view the MathML source"><em>O</em><sub><em>a</em><em>c</em></sub></span></span> network better reflects the
			conceptualizations of those closer to the core of the community. Combined together, our findings confirm that the <span id="mmlsi59" title="Click to view the MathML source"><span class="formulatext" title="click to view the MathML source"><em>O</em><sub><em>a</em><em>c</em></sub></span></span>
			network better reflects the conceptualizations of those involved in Semantic Web research, and this holds especially for those
			most actively involved in Semantic Web research.

<h2 class="svArticle" id="sec8">5. Discussion: ontologies and folksonomies</h2>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_58">

			This paper has been first published at the Fourth International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC) held in Galway, Ireland in
			November 2005. The appearance of this paper was the starting sign for an important discussion in the Web community about the
			place of folksonomies in the Semantic Web vision. This discussion still carries on today.<span id="bfn8"><a class="intra_ref" href="#fn8" id="ancbfn8"><sup>8</sup></a></span> Unfortunately, it is often trivialized into a slogan-level debate contrasting
			Web 2.0<span id="bfn9"><a class="intra_ref" href="#fn9" id="ancbfn9"><sup>9</sup></a></span> and the Semantic Web. This debate
			between proponents of folksonomies and controlled vocabularies (ontologies) gives the impression as if a single choice would
			need to be made between competing ways of bringing semantics to the Web.
		</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_59">

			We would like to argue here that there is no need to make such a choice: in fact, folksonomies are ontologies. To understand
			why, it is useful to revisit some of the fundamental characterizations of ontologies from the literature. For example, based on
			reports from others on various uses of ontologies Smith and Welty characterize ontologies as a set of representation mechanisms
			that can be classified according their expressivity as shown in <span id="bfig3"><a class="intra_ref" href="#fig3" id="ancbfig3">Fig. 3</a></span><span id="bbib5"><a class="intra_ref" href="#bib5" id="e_a_55">[5]</a>
. They note that
			there is a point on this scale (marked with the black bar) where automated reasoning becomes useful: this is the point where
			the ontology at least has a stable hierarchy, allowing to reason with subclass relations. Elst and Abecker propose a
			three-dimensional classification of the formality, stability, and sharing scope of knowledge <span id="bbib14"><a class="intra_ref" href="#bib14" id="e_a_56">[14]</a>
). In other words, it is difficult if not
			impossible to obtain knowledge that is formal, but also dynamic and widely shared. As shown in <span id="bfig5"><a class="intra_ref" href="#fig5" id="ancbfig5">Fig. 5</a></span>, this classification is simplified into two dimensions in our own
			survey of ontology-based Knowledge Management <span id="bbib4"><a class="intra_ref" href="#bib4" id="e_a_59">[4]</a>
,
			where ontology-based applications are classified according to their level of expressivity (the Semantic dimension) and their
			level of distribution<span id="bfn10"><a class="intra_ref" href="#fn10" id="ancbfn10"><sup>10</sup></a></span> (the Web
			dimension). We also noted based on the evidence of existing applications that it seems difficult to go forward along both
			dimensions simultaneously: highly formal knowledge requires commitment that is difficult to achieve in a large scale, while
			ontologies that are widely shared (lightweight web ontologies such as RSS and FOAF) are necessarily shallow due to their
			sharing scope. Stability, although not a separate dimension, also clearly plays a role in this: large scale systems like the
			Web are very dynamic, while achieving significant ontological commitment (formality) would require stability. This
			classification has been widely used since, e.g. populated with applications and technologies as in <span id="bfig6"><a class="intra_ref" href="#fig6" id="ancbfig6">Fig. 6</a></span>. As expected, existing work is situated in the upper left or lower
			right corners of the matrix, while the theoretically problematic upper right corner is empty.

<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_64">

			If we interpret the term ontology to cover the whole spectrum, it is easy to show that folksonomies simply represent different
			positions on the scales than the more formal controlled vocabularies traditionally employed by the Semantic Web community.
			Folksonomies are <em>lightweight</em>, in fact so light that many in the Semantic Web community consider them &lsquo;useless&rsquo; in the
			sense that automated reasoning using logical approaches cannot be applied (i.e. folksonomies are to the left of the bar on the
			scale of <span id="bfig3"><a class="intra_ref" href="#fig3" id="ancbfig3">Fig. 3</a></span>). However, as we have shown in this
			work there is more semantics in folksonomies than meets the eye. The methods to extract it are not logic based, but borrowed
			from network analysis and in fact folksonomies may require a shift in the methods applied by the Semantic Web community.
		</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_65">

			Folksonomies are also <em>dynamic</em>&ndash; changing over time with every tagging action &ndash; as opposed to the more stable structures
			that most semantic applications are built on. Again, many would argue that this renders folksonomies useless for any purpose
			other than knowledge discovery. For example, one may not want to describe the parameters of a web service using a folksonomy
			because such a web service could not be relied on by dependent services.<span id="bfn11"><a class="intra_ref" href="#fn11" id="ancbfn11"><sup>11</sup></a></span> We note here, however, that in practice folksonomies are much less volatile than many
			would expect. We believe that the majority of terms has a single well-defined meaning that remains stable over long periods of
			time. Also, while the objects tagged may change on a daily basis, the overall focus of the del.icio.us community, for example,
			changes much slower. Although investigating the temporal dimension of folksonomies is subject of future work (the work of
			Dubinko et al. in visualizing tags over time is an important step in this direction <span id="bbib15"><a class="intra_ref" href="#bib15" id="e_a_75">[15]</a>
), we expect that folksonomies have a substantial stable backbone if we observe them
			for longer periods of time. Much like ontologies that stabilize after long, heated debates, these stable parts of folksonomies
			can in fact be considered as lightweight ontologies that represent a consensus over the meaning of terms.
		</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_66">

			In terms of sharing, folksonomies have a very <em>limited scope</em> compared to ontologies. Due to their dynamics and
			lightweight nature, the mapping of folksonomies is a predictably difficult, if not impossible challenge. Tagging systems at the
			moment represent islands of semantics that do not cross the boundaries of a single website. Even if we could capture, for
			example, the relationship between the tag <em>ruby</em> on del.icio.us and the same tag on Flickr that mapping would need to be
			just as volatile as the semantics of the terms themselves.
		</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_67">
Lightweight, dynamic and limited in sharing scope, folksonomies are a different kind of
			ontology than the more formal and stable controlled vocabularies advocated by the Semantic Web community for the Web. Their
			applications are also different and thus they are unlikely to replace or even compete with logic-based approaches.
			Folksonomies, however, will have a significant impact on realizing the original vision of the Semantic Web as an enrichment of
			the current Web. In particular, it is the first time that the barriers of providing knowledge have been lowered to such an
			extent that ordinary users are willing to provide metadata on web resources on a large scale.</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_68">
Although the semantics is much more implicit, the collective actions of a large number of
			individuals can still lead to the emergence of semantics. Furthermore, the metadata in tagging systems comes with an important
			new attribute, namely the identity of the individuals who have associated a certain tag with a certain object. This social
			dimension of ontologies and its effects on semantics has been the subject of our paper.</p>
		
<h2 class="svArticle" id="sec9">6. Conclusions and future work</h2>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_69">
The Semantic Web is a web for machines, but the process of creating and maintaining it is
			a social one. Although machines are helpful in manipulating symbols according to pre-defined rules, only the users of the
			Semantic Web have the necessary interpretive and associative capability for creating and maintaining ontologies. Ontology
			creation necessitates a social presence as it requires an actor to reliably predict how other members of the community would
			interpret the symbols of an ontology based on their limited description. With incorporating the notion of semantics into the
			web architecture, we have thus made the users of the system a critical part of the design.</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_70">

			We have argued elsewhere for a three layered view of the Semantic Web, namely the layer of communities and their relations, the
			layer of semantics (ontologies and their relations) and the layer of content items and their relations (the hypertext Web) <span id="bbib16"><a class="intra_ref" href="#bib16" id="e_a_76">[16]</a>
. In this paper we have formalized this view as a
			tripartite model of ontologies with three different classes of nodes (actors, concepts, and instances) and hyperedges
			representing the commitment of a user in terms of classifying an instance as belonging to a certain concept. We have shown the
			usefulness of this model by generating two kinds of association networks: the well-known co-occurrence network of ontology
			learning and a novel semantic network based on community relationships. Among the future work is the study of the two emerging
			social networks, based on object and concept overlaps.
		</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_71">

			The general advantage of the incorporation of the social context into the representation of ontologies is the possibility of
			studying emergence from user actions. Emergent semantics is likely to best complement well-established, but slowly evolving
			ontologies such as WordNet <span id="bbib7"><a class="intra_ref" href="#bib7" id="e_a_77">[7]</a>
, which lack the
			associative component.<span id="bfn12"><a class="intra_ref" href="#fn12" id="ancbfn12"><sup>12</sup></a></span> We have also
			compared the two networks based on object and person overlap and noted the advantage of the second network: the possibility to
			extract semantics pertinent to a sub-community of the user network. In some sense, this is the opposite of mining general
			knowledge from search engines as in the work of Cimiano et al. or Etzioni et al. <span id="bbib17-2"><a class="intra_ref" href="#bib17" id="e_a_79">[17]</a>

			and <span id="bbib18-"><a class="intra_ref" href="#bib18" id="e_a_80">[18]</a>
. In comparison to these systems, our community-based ontology
			extraction has a great potential in extracting ontologies that more closely match the conceptualization of a particular
			community. For example, when trying to find associations between concepts used by the Web Services community, it is natural to
			consider only the associations created (explicitly or implicitly) by those involved in developing Web Services. As we have
			shown, using this method the resulting ontology is more likely to be accepted as accurate by the community itself.
		</p>
		
<p class="svArticle section" id="e_p_72">
It seems that ontologies are us: inseparable from the context of the community in which
			they are created and used. A greater acknowledgement of this state &ndash; by incorporating the link between actors and concepts into
			the model of ontologies &ndash; have only benefits to bring in terms of more meaningful and easily maintainable conceptual
			structures. While we are only at the beginning of realizing these benefits, there is a clear magic as we see semantics emerge
			from the individual actions of a community at work.</p>

							For example, according to WordNet the distance of the terms <em>Noah</em> and <em>ark</em> is quite large: their closest
							common ancestor in the hypernym tree is <em>object, physical object</em>. Yet, the Edinburgh master&rsquo;s students
							overwhelmingly associate the term <em>Noah</em> with <em>ark</em> and vice versa. The association is so strong in fact (78
							and 79% of all terms mentioned in response, respectively) that it is safe to say that in the mind of the students these
							terms are solely defined by each other, in the context of the biblical story of Noah&rsquo;s ark.
