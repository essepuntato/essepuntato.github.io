T1: The reference reports an case-study/experiment of ontology enrichment (N)
T2: Evidence: First, the set of words is not fixed. Evidence: Second, although we use the term concept in the following, it is clear that there is no one-to-one correspondence between concepts and keywords. Evidence: Lastly, the instances of folksonomies are instances only in the sense of classification. (Y)
T3: Conceiving Folksonomies (N)
SUS: 3,2,3,2,4,1,3,2,3,2
Q1: Very effectively. At the beginning, though, I looked for the answers straight into the text. For this reason, I probably I gave some wrong answer at the beginning.
Q2: Content-structured lists.
Q3: It was separated from the "standard" text, i.e. from standard layout, which I looked at straight into in order to answer questions.
Q4: Some layout improvements (i.e. same label colours) helping users to match easily text elements with TAL elements.

T1: Because it relates to related work (N)
T2: Evidence: First, the set of words is not fixed. Evidence: Second, although we use the term concept in the following, it is clear that there is no one-to-one correspondence between concepts and keywords. Evidence: Lastly, the instances of folksonomies are instances only in the sense of classification. (Y)
T3: ProblemStatement - Conceiving ontologies as engineering artifacts allows us to objectify them, separate them from their original social context of creation and transfer them across the domain. Problems arise with this simplistic view, however, if we consider the temporal extent of knowledge. As the original community evolves through members leaving and entering or their commitments changing, a new consensus may shape up invalidating the knowledge codified in the ontology. Rhetoric Denotation: ProblemStatement - Folksonomies such as del.icio.us are effective, because they attract sizeable sub-communities of users pursuing similar interests. Nevertheless, the community of del.icio.us is still a niche compared to the general web population, just as the number of web sites tagged is only a fraction of the number of pages on the Web. Rhetoric Denotation: ProblemStatement - We would like to show in the following that even without explicitly assigned tags, it is possible to extend the idea of community-based ontology extraction to the Web. Let’s suppose that we have a selected a community, whose members will play the role of Actors in our model, and we have prepared a list of terms whose associations we are interested in. The instances of our model are the pages of the Web. Further, we assume that a web page is tagged by a concept if the concept occurs on the page. (Y)

Q1: It was quite helpful
Q2: The hyperlink navigation between contents and the help window at the bottom
Q3: Maybe the Argumentation Index is too long to be consulted exhaustively (61 claims)
Q4: Maybe the help bar could be enriched in order to allow a more friendly navigation (e.g., by adding a Denotation Index which groups the various denotations such as Problem Statement, Motivations, Model etc...)

Q1: The tool supported me in answering taks by providing an efficient way for summarizing the main features of an article helping the user in identifying core rhetoric denotations and providing an easy to use interface for exploring article's argumentations and citations. In addition, in my opinion the added value of the tool are the explanations that the tool provides for argumentations (by means of Evidence, Warrant, Qualifier, etc.) and citations (by means of a very useful tooltip that qualifies the nature of the citation).
Q2: The features the I found most useful are: * the two indexed for citations and argumentation * the tooltip for explaining citations in the text * the effective summarization of claims with related Evidence, Warrant, Qualifier, etc.
Q3: The behavior of the tooltip in my opinion should be always the same. I got a little bit confused because: * with the mouse hover on claims something was displayed, while nothing happened with the mouse hover citations * a very different output is presented when the mouse hovers on references in the article
Q4: I would like to see more integration between the tool and the article. This means, for instance, when a user click on some claim the tool should point out the same part in the article.

SUS: 5,2,4,1,3,2,4,1,4,1
Q1: The labels about 'Rhetoric Denotation', 'Claim', 'Evidence', etc. make very clear to identify the role of each piece of content. Such a characterization helped me answering questions easily.
Q2: The labels on each paragraphs and the box in the right bottom of the page (characterizing citations)
Q3: The lack of an integrated search. Information is clear and evident but I have to say that I searched it by using the browser searching tool
Q4: - search interface - index of claim components (Evidence, Warrant, Qualifier, etc...) - the information about a reference should also be displayed on a mouseOver in he bibliography entry and not only in the in-line occurrences
