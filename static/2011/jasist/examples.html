			This HTML document links all the EARMARK documents presented in the submitted JASIST article <em>A Semantic Web Approach To Everyday Overlapping Markup</em>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each following section includes a descriptive figure of the document structure and the source of the related document, linearised in Turtle.
		</p>
		<p>
			All the document examples are downloadable as <a href="examples.zip">archive</a> too.
		</p>
		<h2>Kinds of overlap</h2>
		<p>
			Markup items are the main structural entity of each EARMARK document. By means of the expressiveness of EARMARK, it is of course possible to create overlapping between them. As shown in Figure 1, we define that two markup items <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> overlap when at least one of the following sentences holds:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>[overlap by range]</strong> A contains a range that overlaps with another range contained by B – implemented in the EARMARK document <a href="ttl/OverlapByRange.ttl">OverlapByRange.ttl</a></li>
			<li><strong>[overlap by content hierarchy]</strong> A and B contain at least a range in common – implemented in EARMARK document <a href="ttl/OverlapByContentHierarchy.ttl">OverlapByContentHierarchy.ttl</a></li>
			<li><strong>[overlap by markup hierarchy]</strong> A and B contain at least a markup item in common – implemented in the EARMARK document <a href="ttl/OverlapByMarkupHierarchy.ttl">OverlapByMarkupHierarchy.ttl</a></li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Word processor change tracking</h2>
		<p>
			A large number of XML-formats for word processors, when saving change tracking information, usually rely on two specific constructs for insertions and deletions that may overlap with the structural markup. For example, Figure 2 summarizes all the modifications concerning a simple excerpt from a word processor document. Look at  <a href="ttl/WordProcessorChangeTracking.ttl">WordProcessorChangeTracking.ttl</a> for the related EARMARK implementation of it.

		</div>
		<h2>Microformats</h2>
		<p>
			Overlapping problems are present when the overall structure of an HTML table is at odds with the intrinsic hierarchy of some microformat data, as shown in Figure 3 in which five different hierarchies lie upon the same textual content. This scenario is easily expressible in EARMARK as implemented in <a href="ttl/MicroformatTable.ttl">MicroformatTable.ttl</a>.

		</div>
		<h2>Wiki change tracking</h2>
		<p>
			Common wiki reversion mechanisms still have some significative limitations, e.g., the automatic filtering and merging of contributions from multiple versions of the same page is now still a manual process. Of course, it can be fully automatized if the overlapping structures buried in the whole history of the page become explicit, as shown in Figure 4. EARMARK allows to structure the article history explicitly, for example as implemented in <a href="ttl/WikiChangeTracking.ttl">WikiChangeTracking.ttl</a>.
