			This HTML document describes all the outcomes of the three experiments performed and described in the evaluation section of the article submitted for publication in <em><a href="http://www.journals.elsevier.com/information-sciences/">Information Sciences</a></em>, entitled <em>Towards the emergence of a simple categorisation of folksonomic tags: topicality vs. non-topicality</em>.
		</p>
		
		<h2>First experiment</h2>
		<p>In the first test, the output of NTDS was used against comparable evaluations based on the same input data performed by three human cataloguers on a small set of randomly chosen tags. In this test, a shared common-sense definition of topical tags was used by the human cataloguers, who had access to the full set of information available on the tag, including the resources themselves which the tags where associated to.</p>
		<p>The tags used in the test, the related documents and the classification of the three cataloguers are available as <a href="test1.xlsx">Excel file</a> and as <a href="test1.csv">CSV</a>.</p>
		
		
		<h2>Second experiment</h2>
		<p>In the second test we provided three human cataloguers with a more precise, almost algorithmic definition of topicality, and applied it to a different, and explicitly chosen, set of tags. This improved a bit the inter-human agreement (in as much as they strictly followed the proposed algorithm – although it created dissatisfactions in a few cases), but created clear outliers in the comparison with the output of the NTDS algorithm.</p>
		<p>The tags used in the test, the related documents and the classification of the three cataloguers are available as <a href="test2.xlsx">Excel file</a> and as <a href="test2.csv">CSV</a>.</p>
		
		
		<h2>Third experiment</h2>
		<p>We then decided to add a folksonomic flavour to our test, and verify the predictive value of the output of the NTDS algorithm, i.e. how well its values agree with the expected characterisation of a tag by humans, who most often try to evaluate the nature of a tag without accessing the resources that would disambiguate it. A larger number of tags were evaluated in a simpler fashion by a larger number of testers.</p>
		<p>The tags used in the test, the related documents and the classification of the three cataloguers are available as <a href="test3.xlsx">Excel file</a> and as <a href="test3.csv">CSV</a>.</p>
