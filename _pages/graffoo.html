        <p><strong><em>Graffoo</em></strong>, a <em><strong>Gra</strong>phical <strong>F</strong>ramework <strong>f</strong>or <strong>O</strong>WL <strong>O</strong>ntologies</em>, is an open source tool that can be used to present the classes, properties and restrictions within OWL ontologies, or sub-sections of them, as clear and easy-to-understand diagrams. Several Graffoo diagrams have been developed to explain, e.g., <a href="http://www.sparontologies.net" title="The Semantic Publishing And Referencing ontologies homepage">SPAR ontologies</a> - that are to be found in the appropriate <a href="https://github.com/sparontologies/">ontology directories</a> - and the <a href="http://www.essepuntato.it/2011/02/argumentmodel">Argument Model Ontology</a>, shown in Figure 1.</p>

        <p>The advantages of using such a Grafoo diagram are thus that it displays the logical relationships between elements of an ontology, or a sub-section of an ontology, in a manner that is relatively straightforward to understand, once one has grasped the meaning of the different elements of a Graffoo diagram. These elements are shown and defined in the Graffoo key (Figure 2) and fully presented in the <a href="specification/current.html">official specification</a>.</p>

        <p>Preliminary empirical studies, it appears that Graffoo allows to create representations of OWL ontologies that can be comprehended in detail without the person viewing them having to understand the details of OWL 2 or of any of its linearizations (Turtle, RDF/XML, Manchester Syntax, or OWL/XML).</p>
        
        <h2 id="install">How to install Graffoo</h2>
        
        <p>Graffoo has been developed using the standard library of the <a href="http://www.yworks.com/products/yed/">yEd diagram editor</a>, a free diagram editor running on Windows, Mac and Linux. The <em>graphml</em> format version of those Graffoo objects is also <a href="/assets/diagram/Graffoo.graphml">available</a>. It can be imported as new <em>Section</em> of the <em>yEd Palette</em>.</p>
        
        <p>To install Graffoo, please follow the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
        	<li>install <a href="http://www.yworks.com/en/products_yed_about.html">yEd</a>, a free diagram editor tool;</li>
        	<li>download the <a href="/assets/diagram/Graffoo.graphml">Graffoo.graphml file</a>;</li>
        	<li>import it as a palette on <em>yEd</em> - <em>Click on Edit</em> -> <em>Manage Palette</em> -> <em>Import
Section</em>, then select the downloaded file, add it, and include it in the available
palettes;</li>
        	<li>start creating diagrams!</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Luigi Asprino has recently developed also a <a href="https://draw.io/">draw.io</a> palette for Graffoo. Please follow the following steps to use it:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>create/open a diagram in draw.io;</li>
            <li>import it as a palette on <em>draw.io</em> - Click on <em>File</em> -> <em>Open Library from</em> -> <em>URL</em>
            <li>insert URL <code>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luigi-asprino/Graffoo4DrawIO/master/Graffoo.xml</code>;</li>
            <li>start creating diagrams!</li>
        </ol>
