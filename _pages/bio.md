I (ORCiD: [0000-0003-0530-4305](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0530-4305)) hold a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and I am an Associate Professor at the [Department of Classical Philology and Italian Studies](http://www.ficlit.unibo.it/), [University of Bologna](http://www.unibo.it/en), where I [teach](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/silvio.peroni/teachings) *Basic Informatics* (Bachelor's degree in [Humanities](https://corsi.unibo.it/1cycle/Humanities)) and *Computational Thinking and Programming* (Master's degree in [Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/DigitalHumanitiesKnowledge)). 

I am an expert in document markup and semantic descriptions of bibliographic entities using OWL ontologies. I am one of the main developers of the [SPAR (Semantic Publishing and Referencing) Ontologies](http://www.sparontologies.net), Director (with [David Shotton](https://twitter.com/dshotton)) of [OpenCitations](http://opencitations.net), and founding member of the [Initiative for Open Citations (I4OC)](https://i4oc.org).

My work on Semantic Publishing topics has been published by Springer in a book entitled *[Semantic Web Technologies and Legal Scholarly Publishing](http://www.springer.com/it/book/9783319047768)*. I count several [publications](/pub/) international journals – including [Semantic Web](http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/), [Web Semantics](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-web-semantics/), [Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)2330-1643), [PeerJ Computer Science](https://peerj.com/computer-science/), and [Scientometrics](https://link.springer.com/journal/11192) – and [presentations](/tlk/) in important international conferences. 

I am an Editorial Board member of [Data Science](https://datasciencehub.net/), [PeerJ Computer Science](https://peerj.com/computer-science/), and [Research Ideas and Outcomes](https://riojournal.com/), and I have been in the Program Committee and in the Organising Committee of the most important international conferences and workshops related to Web and Semantic Web technologies. I am director of the [Research Centre for Open Scholarly Metadata](https://openscholarlymetadata.org), member of the [Digital Humanities Advanced Research Centre (/DH.arc)](https://dharc.unibo.it), part of the Advisory Board of [DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/) and [Qeios](https://www.qeios.com/), Ambassador of [Figshare](https://figshare.com/) and [PeerJ](https://peerj.com), and member of the [Association for Computing Machinery](https://www.acm.org/), of the [International Society for Scientometrics and Informetrics](http://issi-society.org/), and of the [Associazione per l’Informatica Umanistica e la Cultura Digitale](http://www.aiucd.it).

Among my research interests are Semantic Web technologies, markup languages for complex documents, design patterns for digital documents and ontology modelling, and automatic processes of analysis and segmentation of documents. In particular, my recent works concern the empirical analysis of the nature of scholarly citations, bibliometrics and scientometrics studies, visualisation and browsing interfaces for semantic data, and the development of ontologies to manage, integrate and query bibliographic information.
