I - a.k.a. S. (pronounced "essepuntato" in Italian), better known as Silvio Peroni - am an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at the [Department of Classical Philology and Italian Studies](http://www.ficlit.unibo.it/), [University of Bologna](http://www.unibo.it/en), proud member of the [Digital Humanities Advanced Research Centre (/DH.arc)](https://dharc.unibo.it) and of the [Science of Science gang](https://sosgang.github.io).

This page is a sort of bucket where I put things that concern my works, publications, hobbies, and the like, but you may find some more information about teaching material and courses at my [institutional homepage](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/silvio.peroni/en) (maybe). Thus, if you were looking for something interesting, smart and curious, this is not the right place. Sincerely.

Just in case you are still there, reading words and words of non-sense grammatical constructions, it is totally up to you.
