I - a.k.a. S. (pronounced "essepuntato" in Italian), better known as Silvio Peroni - am an Associate Professor in Computer Science at the [Department of Classical Philology and Italian Studies](http://www.ficlit.unibo.it/), [University of Bologna](http://www.unibo.it/en), proud member of the [Digital Humanities Advanced Research Centre (/DH.arc)](https://dharc.unibo.it) and director of [OpenCitations](https://opencitations.net), the [Research Centre for Open Scholarly Metadata](https://openscholarlymetadata.org), and the [Second Cycle Degree in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge (DHDK)](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/DigitalHumanitiesKnowledge).

This page is a sort of bucket where I put things that concern my works, publications, hobbies, and the like, but you may find more information about teaching material and courses at my [institutional homepage](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/silvio.peroni/en) (maybe). Thus, if you were looking for something interesting, smart and curious, this is not the right place. Sincerely.

Just in case you are still there, reading words and words of non-sense grammatical constructions, it is totally up to you.
